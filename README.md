SQL Server Connector Proof-of-Concept (C++ / UnixODBC / ODBC Driver 18)

This repository contains a minimalist C++ Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to establish and validate SQL Server connectivity from Linux/Unix environments (such as Oracle Linux, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, etc.).

The project focuses on leveraging the Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 (msodbcsql18) and the unixODBC driver manager as a bridge for the C++ application.
